# News A.I. Choose
The goal of New A.I. Choose is to train machine learning models to accurately predict the category of a news article based on the article body and other context clues. Additionally, this project intends to provide a front-end web interface for users to interact with stories by requesting more positive or more negative new stories. Users will also be able to assist the model by verifying if the recommendation is accurate - this will be used in future training to fine tune the models.

# Development
set up and activate virtual environment, install requirements
```shell
$ python3 -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

start a local dev session by running `./local_dev.sh`.

If this is your first time running the shell script you may need to `chmod +x local_dev.sh`
